# Als√∏ Wik
A game made in HTML and Javascript. Intended as a party game where you have to present random wikiHow images in a way that makes sense.

Based on a script I made for [Google Slides](https://gist.github.com/ambiguousname/5b0fb3135e2e9355509fac9387add3b4)

Uses [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com), [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Radial Indicator](https://s-yadav.github.io/radialIndicator/), [PJs](https://github.com/PimpTrizkit/PJs/wiki/12.-Shade,-Blend-and-Convert-a-Web-Color-(pSBC.js)#--version-2-universal-b--:), [Bootstrap-Colorpicker](https://itsjavi.com/bootstrap-colorpicker/index.html), and [wikiHow](https://wikihow.com/).

Things I'm thinking of doing:
- Redesigned Options
- Panic Attack Mode (In the style of PechaKucha)
- Multiple Wikis to Pull From
- Text Slides
- NSFW filter option?
