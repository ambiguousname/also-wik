# Also Wik
A game made in HTML and Javascript. Intended as a party game where you have to present random wikiHow images in a way that makes sense.

Based on a script I made for [Google Slides](https://gist.github.com/ambiguousname/5b0fb3135e2e9355509fac9387add3b4)

Things I'm thinking of adding:
Redesigned Options
Panic Attack Mode
Multiple Wikis to Pull From
Text Slides
